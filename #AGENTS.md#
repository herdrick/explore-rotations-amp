## Commands
- **Run script**: `python rotate_2d_live.py`
- **No tests** currently exist in this repository

## Architecture
- Single-file Python script for visualizing 2D rotations
- Uses matplotlib with interactive sliders to demonstrate rotation matrices

## Code Style
- Python 3 with numpy and matplotlib dependencies
- Constants: uppercase (e.g., `P` for point matrix)
- Mathematical variables: single letters following convention (e.g., `theta`, `R2`)
- Matplotlib backend defaults to standard, TkAgg commented out if needed

## running Python code
- Make sure you are using a conda env called '<your name>-numpy-matplotlib-1'.  If it doesn't exist, create it.  Then if you need to pip install, be sure to "python -m pip install ...".
- 

## git
- if you do a commit, append " :: <your name>" where <your name> is the name of you, the agent
